## Customization

### Nuxt HeadlessUI Dialog

This boilerplate includes a modal/dialog component using Nuxt HeadlessUI. To customize the dialog, you can find the component in the components/ folder.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind is already configured in the project. You can modify the tailwind.config.js to adjust theme settings, breakpoints, and more.

### Nuxt UI

Nuxt UI is already configured in the project. You can modify the app.config.ts to customize the look and feel of the components at runtime with HMR. Check out the [Nuxt UI docs](https://ui.nuxt.com/getting-started/theming)

### i18n Setup

This boilerplate uses `@nuxtjs/i18n` for internationalization. Currently, it includes support for English (en) and German (de), with lazy-loaded language files.

You can add more languages or modify the existing ones by editing the `i18n` configuration in `nuxt.config.ts`:

```
i18n: {
locales: [
{ name: 'English', code: 'en', iso: 'en-GB', file: 'en.json' },
{ name: 'Deutsch', code: 'de', iso: 'de-DE', file: 'de.json' },
],
defaultLocale: 'en',
lazy: true,
langDir: 'i18n/',
strategy: 'prefix_except_default',
}
```

Add or update translation files in the `i18n/` folder.
